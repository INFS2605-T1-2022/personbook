# INFS2605 Personbook (Homework 3)

**This task must be completed individually. Your work for this task must be uploaded to Moodle before your Week 10 tutorial, as a typed document.**

Download this “Personbook” project as a Zip file. Build and run the project on NetBeans. 

On the Personbook application, start adding a new person or try to edit an existing person’s data to catch the exceptions. (hint: intentionally enter wrong parameters where certain inputs are expected).

In a max. 1 page response, please answer these 3 questions:

1. Can you find the examples of throwing an Exception?
2. Can you find the examples of catching Exceptions?
3. What are the two types of Exceptions that are used to validate the data entry, and why do we need both of them?
4. Imagine if we need to display only one kind of alert to the user for both kinds of data entry (as opposed to the two kinds currently shown). How could we simplify the code? (hint: look up “catch all Exception java”)
