# INFS2605 Personbook (Homework 3)

**This task must be completed individually. Your work for this task must be uploaded to Moodle before your Week 10 tutorial, as a typed document.**

Inspect this example implementation of "Personbook" at on GitHub Classroom (the link will be announced on Moodle).

In a max. 1 page response, please answer these 3 questions:

1. Can you find the example of throwing an Exception?
2. Can you find the examples of catching Exceptions?
3. What are the two types of Exceptions that are used to validate the data entry, and why do we need both of them?
4. If we only needed to display only one kind of alert to the user for both kinds of data entry (as opposed to the two kinds currently shown), how could we simplify the code? (hint: look up “catch all Exception java”)
